History
The Kentucky Colonels were a member of the American Basketball Association
 for all of the league's nine years. The name is derived from the historic
  Kentucky colonels. The Colonels won the most games and had the highest 
  winning percentage of any franchise in the league's history, 
  but the team did not join the NBA in the 1976 ABA–NBA merger. 
  The downtown Louisville Convention Center (now known as The Gardens) 
  was the Colonels' original venue for the first three seasons 
  before moving to Freedom Hall for the remaining seasons, 
  beginning with the 1970–71 schedule.
